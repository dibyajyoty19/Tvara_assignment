# Tvara_assignment
This repository contains my solutions to the Tvara AI Interview Challenge, covering Data Structures &amp; Algorithms, API integration with a modern LLM, and vector similarity search using Hugging Face embeddings.
Note on Environment
Due to temporary device limitations, I implemented and tested this project using Google Colab instead of a local VS Code setup.
I’ve ensured the code remains clean, modular, and well-commented, so it can be easily migrated to a local environment without changes.
