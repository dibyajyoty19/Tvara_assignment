# Tvara_assignment
This repository contains my solutions to the Tvara AI Interview Challenge, covering Data Structures &amp; Algorithms, API integration with a modern LLM, and vector similarity search using Hugging Face embeddings.
## Note on Environment
Due to temporary device limitations, I implemented and tested this project using Google Colab instead of a local VS Code setup.
I’ve ensured the code remains clean, modular, and well-commented, so it can be easily migrated to a local environment without changes.

*I have not created any .env files as i have not used the required coding environment so for no accidental leakage of API_key  i have removed the key from the code.
